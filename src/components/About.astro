<p>
	Hello, I'm Dane. I'm passionate about building robust and efficient
	software solutions, working across the entire development process from
	concept to deployment. I particularly enjoy the blend of crafting engaging
	user interfaces on the front-end and architecting scalable logic and data
	systems on the back-end. My technical experience allows me to tackle diverse
	challenges effectively.
</p>
<p>
	My journey into technology began uniquely â€“ through Minecraft. Experimenting
	with its Redstone mechanics sparked my curiosity, offering a hands-on way to
	grasp fundamental concepts like digital logic and low-level computing
	principles, akin to understanding how computers operate at a binary level.
	This experience of learning complex ideas through engaging play inspires my
	aspiration today: to help bring young people into computer science using
	similarly fun and accessible methods, potentially leveraging games as
	educational tools.
